* Plague Doctor
** What?
Plague Doctors were Medival physicians who treated victims of the
bubonic plague. They would go around from city to city, attempting to
cure those affected by the plague.  Similar to Plague Doctors, this
service serves as a connection between other services, resolving
communications and issues that arise from one microservice to
another. In addition to serving as the backend to the front end
component, it will also handle some major application features such as
authentication, fule uploading, and cms.
